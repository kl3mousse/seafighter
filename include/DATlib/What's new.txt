Misc code related
-----------------

- Added a buffer for fix commands.
- Functions clearing sprites no longer resets the shrink values.
- Added alternate IRQ safe versions of functions when necessary.

aSprite related
---------------

- Palette data can now be accessed through spriteInfo structure.
- Fixed 1px offset when X flipped and/or Y flipped.
- Ability to initialize without issuing a sprite clear.
- Flags are now passed on upon initialization.
- Current animation#, step#, and repeats# are now properly tracked.
- Introduced alternate coordinates mode (strict coordinates).
- New functions: aSpriteSetAnim2
                 aSpriteSetStep
                 aSpriteSetStep2
                 aSpriteSetAnimStep
                 aSpriteSetAnimStep2


spritePool related
------------------

- New function:  spritePoolDrawList2


scroller related
----------------

- Palette data can now be accessed through scrollerInfo structure.
- Rewrote code, improved performance.
- scroller functions now updates tilemap data on a per tile basis.


picture related
---------------

- Palette data can now be accessed through pictureInfo structure.





Version 0.2 updates:
====================

Introduced sprite pools, check documentation.
Introduced a new sprite framing tool.


Tools related
-------------

- Fixed various glitches/crashes/file locks across tools.
- Buildchar: tool now requires to specify input xml file. Added config options, see doc.
             This allow to alleviate char processing time by splitting assets into multiple files.
- Buildchar: it is now possible to mix auto4 and auto8 tiles on the same file.
- Buildchar: when processing sprites, data not used in frames is now ignored.


Misc code related
-----------------

- Switched draw commands tables addressing mode (from index to pointer).
  This changes nothing except if you made custom code to write in these tables.
- Added draw buffers usage meter (dip 2-3).
- Squeezed out some more CPU cycles here and there.
- Renamed a few element for consistency:
	wait_vblank()	=>	waitVBlank()
	Scroller	=>	scroller
	Picture		=>	picture
- Revamped timer interrupt code:
	* Runs faster
	* Should now retain effect on dropped frames.
	* Now uses the USP register, no more OS writing for you.
	* Changed data format for rasters info, check doc.
	* Removed the default raster data tables, allocate your own tables if you use timer interrupt.
	* Can now updates two values per IRQ trigger.


aSprite related
---------------

- Fixed issue where aSprite wouldn't initialize properly under certain conditions.
- Added aSpriteHide() & aSpriteShow() methods.





Version 0.1 updates:
====================


Documentation
-------------

- Redone documentation. Better organization, more infos.


Tools related
-------------

- BuildChar: revamped color conversion and added dark bit support.
- BuildChar: dummy tiles inserted to align auto animation tiles are now reused to fit data when possible.
- Animator: improved interface for better animation edits.
- Animator: improved animation playback. Animation speed should be much more faithful to the real thing.


General DATlib usage related
----------------------------
- initGfx() no longer sets up the job meter.
- Introduced jobMeterSetup() to set up job meter.
- Now using debug dips, see documentation for full infos.

aSprite related
---------------

- aSprite now handles variable tile width frames.
- aSpriteAnimate() will no longer issue a tilemap data rewrite when consecutive animation steps are using the same frame.
- Adjusted aSpriteSetAnim() behavior, see doc for full info.
