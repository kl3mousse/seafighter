These two roms
202-m1.bin
202-v1.bin
are the original sound roms from Puzzle De Pon, and while not modified by the compilation process, they are
needed for the game to be complete (and run).
The deployment script copies them from this directory, so DO NOT DELETE THEM.

The other rom files (see names below) for this game are generated from your code by make, followed by makeroms.
202-c1.bin
202-c2.bin
202-p1.bin
202-s1.bin
