Pitfalls:
=========

*	crt0_cart or crt0_cd must always be the first object file

*	When compiling for cart systems the .data section is removed. 
	Thus you can't use global initialized non const data.
  
	Correct:
	========
	
	const int	myint1 = 0xE5E5;
	int			myint2;
  
	void myfunc(void)
	{
		myint2 = 0;
		...

	Incorrect:
	==========
	
	int			myint3 = 0xDEADBEEF;
	
	void myfunc(void)
	{
		int myint5 = 0xBABEEBAB; // OK!
		static int myint4 = 0xDEADDEAD; // value of myint4 will be undefined !  
		test(myint3); // undefined too !  
		...

*	Always declare global initialized data 'const'

*	When interfacing assembly routines, d2-d7/a2-a6 must be preserved.

*	If you don't want to link libvideo you'll have to declare:
	volatile WORD	_vbl_flag;
	somewhere in your code
	
*	Memory maps defined in linker scripts may be incorrect

*	In poll_joystick: Auto-Repeat is not available for start & select buttons

*	When declaring table of strings, you must declare the strings const AND THE 
	ARRAY AS WELL:
	
	Incorrect:
	==========
	
	const char *my_table[] = { "1", "2", "3" };
	
	Correct:
	========
	
	const char* const my_table[] = { "1", "2", "3" };

*	When using the multitasking library, please remember that each task has a 
	limited amount of stack, so try to go easy on the stack.
