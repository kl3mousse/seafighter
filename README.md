one more neogeo homebrew... an **horizontal shooter** you can play on MAME neogeo emulator, or even on arcade MVS board with a NeoSD cadridge able to load roms.

I'm glad you have found this repo :) note that this is not even work in progress.
For now I'm trying to get basic things sorted out, starting with a good dev kit.

*Thanks to the neogeo scene (HPman, Furrtek, dciabrin, ...) for the assets & examples :)
