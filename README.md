one more neogeo homebrew... an **horizontal shooter** you can play on MAME neogeo emulator, or even on arcade MVS board with a NeoSD cadridge able to load roms.

I'm glad you have found this repo :) note that this is not even work in progress.
For now I'm trying to get basic things sorted out, starting with a good dev kit.

The aim of that first game is also to buid a portable game dev environment, by simply copy/pasting this repo (idea for later: build a neogeo dev environment template, ready for coding... ?).

*Thanks to the neogeo scene (HPman, Furrtek, dciabrin, Sebastian Mihai...) for the assets & examples :)*
