# seafighter
one more neogeo homebrew... an **horizontal shooter** you can play on MAME neogeo emulator, or even on arcade MVS board with a NeoSD cadridge able to load roms.

I'm glad you have found this repo :) note that this is work in progress.
For now I'm trying to get basic things sorted out, starting with a good dev kit, that can be easily reused for another project.

*Thanks to the neogeo scene (Sebastian Mihai, HPman, Furrtek, dciabrin, freem/AJ, Vasiliy Familiya...) for the assets & examples :)*

# key programs
- run_me_first.bat: will setup Windows PATH to be able to access compilers and libraries for your C/ASM code into ROMs
- build_Cartridge.bat will compile your code and build roms
- testwithMAME.bat will launch your ROM with MAME
- compileForNeoSD.bat will create a rom in NEO format in order to load it into a NeoSD card

# latest updates
- added XML content for MAME (thanks to Vasiliy Familiya)
- added SRC folder for programs
- removed all files related to NeoGeo CD. Focusing on AES/MVS only.
- added "gfx" folder to store all bitmaps separately
